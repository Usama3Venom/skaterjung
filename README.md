Skaterjung is a simple 2d computer game made using love2d as its framework and lua as its programming language.

It's basically a skater trying to reach the end of the map, avoiding obstacles in the way by jumping over them.

You only need the keyboard to navigate/play the game.

After running the game, you could navigate the Main Menu and sub-menus using the arrow keys and the "return"/"enter" key.

In order to know how to play, navigate to "Instructions" after running the game, and you'll find everything you need there.


PS
You need to download and then install love2d on your computer in order to run the game; you can use this link:
https://love2d.org/

You run the game by dragging the whole folder named "Skaterjung" onto the love application icon (e.g. "love.exe", etc.).
